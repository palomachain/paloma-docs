### The smart messaging chain

Paloma is a Cosmos-SDK blockchain for sending and receiving messages 
from any other blockchain. Paloma’s design aims to enable any developer to control 
any smart contract from the Paloma network. Paloma may be compared to the numerous 
cross-chain messaging protocols currently exploding into the cryptocurrency ecosystem, 
but with a few key differences.

Paloma messages are bidirectional between chains. For example, developers may write 
solidity programs on Ethereum L1 that control contracts running on Osmosis or Fantom. 
Paloma’s pigeons monitor these bidirectional messages and come to a consensus on their 
execution, success, and subsequent logical call for further execution.

Paloma’s messages are natively scheduled and may be repeated. All Paloma messages are 
structured to be scheduled and repeated, as needed, with advanced gas fee management on 
the target chains.

Paloma gas fee management is itself a decentralized oracle for gas fee markets. 
Any blockchain approved by Paloma governance for message routing will reveal a fee 
oracle for the gas market. Paloma developers can predict and assess gas costs, on any 
blockchain, from within Paloma. Paloma validators are compensated for gas fee management 
from the usage of the gas fee oracle.

Paloma’s governance role is to encourage innovation on Paloma, via spending proposals from 
the large community pool that will be a substantial portion of GRAINs, the Paloma protocol 
native token. Governance also aims to protect the chain’s survival during times of unforeseen 
stress that will be a part of this chain’s early life.

Paloma validators can receive additional rewards and compensation for being good messenger 
pigeons through the Paloma gas fee oracle. As validators will need to monitor nodes on any 
blockchain approved by governance, we wish to ensure that paths to revenue for validators 
from emissions and from fees will match the increasing cost of monitoring the explosion of 
public blockchains.
