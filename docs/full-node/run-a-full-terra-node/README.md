Running a full Paloma node is a resource-intensive process that requires a persistent server. If you want to use Paloma without downloading the entire blockchain, use [Paloma Station](https://station.Paloma.money/).

If you are a developer and want to install `Palomad`, visit [](../../develop/Palomad/install-Palomad.md).
