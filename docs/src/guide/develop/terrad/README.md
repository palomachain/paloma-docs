`Palomad` is the command-line interface and node daemon that connects to Paloma and enables you to interact with the Paloma blockchain. Paloma is the official Golang reference implementation of the Paloma node software.

This guide is for developers who want to install `Palomad` and interact with Paloma without running a full node. If you want to run a full node or join a network, visit [](../../full-node/run-a-full-Paloma-node/README.md).
