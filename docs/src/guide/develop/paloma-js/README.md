:::{admonition} Using Paloma.js on the new Paloma chain
:class: tip

Outside of the deprecation of the treasury, market, and oracle modules, Paloma.js functionality remains relatively unchanged. There are a few additions to allow for legacy commands which are explained in the [Using Paloma Classic](./Paloma-classic.md) page. 
:::


Paloma.js seeks to provide a compatible way to work with the Paloma blockchain within JavaScript runtimes, such as Node.js and the browser. Paloma.js enables the following functions:

- Deserializing blockchain data into JavaScript objects with native data types and methods
- Serializing objects back into a blockchain-compatible format
- Providing access to the `Palomad` node API (LCD) from a JavaScript-based interface
- Providing additional utilities, such as hash functions and key-signing algorithms
