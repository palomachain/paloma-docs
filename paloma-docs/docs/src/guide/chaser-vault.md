# Curve Chaser Vault Contract

The `curve_apy_vault.vy` Vyper smart contract contains all the Kallisto Chaser 
Vault functionality. The [source code](https://github.com/kallisto-finance/curve-apy-vault) 
is maintained by the Volume Finance team.

## Swap Routes

The Chaser Vault defines swap routes for Curve. 
The `SwapRoute` takes in the addresses of the Curve pools used in the 
swapping, and defines the incoming token as well as the token to swap into. 

```js
struct SwapRoute:
    swap_pool: address
    j_token: address
    i: int128 # in token index
    j: int128 # out token index
    is_underlying: bool # true if exchange underlying coins using exchange_underlying()
    is_crypto_pool: bool # true if token index in uint256
```

:::details Parameters

| Key | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `swap_pool` | address | swap pool to use for swap |
| `j_token` | address | out token address from the pool |
| `i` | int128 | token index into the pool |
| `j` | address | swap pool to use for swap |
| `is_underlying` | bool | true if exchange underlying coins using exchange_underlying() |
| `is_crypto_pool` | bool | true if token index type is uint256 |

:::

The vault locks the balance using the following data type:

```js
struct LockedBalance:
    amount: int128
    end: uint256
```

> where `amount` is the token amount locked & `end` is the end of the lock period.

# Vault Initiation

The 
[external initiation function](https://github.com/kallisto-finance/curve-apy-vault/blob/main/contracts/curve_apy_vault.vy#L106) is called to set up the vault by specifying the **name**, 
**token**, **main curve pool**, **main deposit address**, **main pool coin count**, 
and the **curve LP token address of the main pool**,  

```js
def __init__(_name: String[64], _symbol: String[32], _main_pool: address, _main_deposit: address, _main_pool_coin_count: uint8, _main_lp_token: address, _main_liquidity_gauge: address, _is_crypto_pool: bool):

        _token,
        concat(
            method_id("approve(address,uint256)"),
            convert(_to, bytes32),
            convert(_value, bytes32)
        ),
        max_outsize=32

            convert(_to, bytes32),
            convert(_value, bytes32)
        ),
        max_outsize=32

def transfer(_to : address, _value : uint256) -> bool:
    assert _to != ZERO_ADDRESS # dev: zero address

    return True
```

### `approve`

    self.allowance[msg.sender][_spender] = allowance
    log Approval(msg.sender, _spender, allowance)
    return True
```

### `decreaseAllowance`

    self.allowance[msg.sender][_spender] = allowance
    log Approval(msg.sender, _spender, allowance)
    return True
```

### `collect_management_fee`

Collects management fee for using Chaser vault.

```js
def collect_management_fee():
    fee_amount: uint256 = (block.timestamp - convert(self.last_management_fee_epoch, uint256)) * convert(self.management_fee, uint256) * self.totalSupply / ONE_YEAR / DENOMINATOR
    if fee_amount > 0:
        self._mint(self.admin, fee_amount)
        self.last_management_fee_epoch = convert(block.timestamp, uint40)

```

### `transfer_admin`

Transfer the admin address to another one.

```js
def transfer_admin(_admin: address):
# transfer admin permission
    old_admin: address = self.admin
    assert msg.sender == old_admin and _admin != ZERO_ADDRESS and old_admin != _admin
    self.validators[old_admin] = False
    self.validators[msg.sender] = True
    self.admin = _admin
```

### `set_validator`

Register a new validator or remove a current validator.

```js
def set_validator(_validator: address, _value: bool):
    assert msg.sender == self.admin
    self.validators[_validator] = _value
```

## Functions that Interact with Curve

### `deposit`

#### `@internal`

The 
[internal deposit function](https://github.com/kallisto-finance/curve-apy-vault/blob/7b4d9a4677b434282b19a39cdf7cba2272ec4b14/contracts/curve_apy_vault.vy#L273) interacts with 
Curve's smart contracts and adds liquidity for one token into a Curve liquidity pool.

```js
def _deposit(main_pool_: address, _main_deposit: address, _main_pool_coin_count: uint8, i: int128, in_token: address, in_amount: uint256):
```

The 
[internal vote-escrowed deposit function](https://github.com/kallisto-finance/curve-apy-vault/blob/7b4d9a4677b434282b19a39cdf7cba2272ec4b14/contracts/curve_apy_vault.vy#L273) interacts with 
Curve's smart contracts to add a locked balance as stake into a Curve liquidity pool.

```js
def ve_deposit(liquidity_gauge: address, _crv_balance: uint256):
```

#### `@external`

The 
[external deposit function](https://github.com/kallisto-finance/curve-apy-vault/blob/7b4d9a4677b434282b19a39cdf7cba2272ec4b14/contracts/curve_apy_vault.vy#L477) works as a 
wrapper of the internal deposit and swap functions. It is called when users deposit their 
tokens into the vault. Upon being called, it swaps some of the deposit tokens for the tokens 
required by the pool, and adds liquidity.  

```js
def deposit(token_address: address, amount: uint256, i: int128, swap_route: DynArray[SwapRoute, MAX_SWAP], min_amount: uint256) -> uint256:
```

### `swap`

The 
[internal swap function](https://github.com/kallisto-finance/curve-apy-vault/blob/7b4d9a4677b434282b19a39cdf7cba2272ec4b14/contracts/curve_apy_vault.vy#L396) interacts with Curve's smart contract and 
uses a Curve liquidity pool to swap one token for another. Upon being called, 
the function swaps the specified amount of the from_token for the to_token. The 
inputs include the Curve liquidity pool's address, the indices for the from_token 
and to_token, the addresses for the two tokens, the amount to swap for the from_token, 
and whether the pool is a crypto pool.

```js
def _swap(pool: address, i: int128, j: int128, from_token: address, to_token: address, is_underlying: bool, from_amount: uint256, is_crypto_pool: bool) -> uint256:
```

### `withdraw`

#### `@internal`

The 
[internal withdraw function](https://github.com/kallisto-finance/curve-apy-vault/blob/main/contracts/curve_apy_vault.vy#L448) interacts with the Curve smart contracts directly. It approves 
the transaction and removes liquidity in one token. The function requires inputs 
specifying the LP tokens and the main pool address to remove liquidity and returned 
token address, index, and the amount.

```js
def _withdraw(lp_token: address, _main_pool: address, out_token: address, i: int128, out_amount: uint256) -> uint256:
```

#### `@external`

The 
[external withdraw function](https://github.com/kallisto-finance/curve-apy-vault/blob/7b4d9a4677b434282b19a39cdf7cba2272ec4b14/contracts/curve_apy_vault.vy#L577) is a wrapper 
of the internal withdraw function. It is called when users withdraw liquidity from the vault. 
The inputs include withdrawal token address and amount, swap route, and the minimal amount 
for swapping. Since the users' withdrawal token may differ from the pool's tokens, a swap 
will be applied in that case.

```js
def withdraw(token_address: address, amount: uint256, i: int128, swap_route: DynArray[SwapRoute, MAX_SWAP], min_amount: uint256) -> uint256:
```

### `update_pool`

The 
[internal update pool function](https://github.com/kallisto-finance/curve-apy-vault/blob/7b4d9a4677b434282b19a39cdf7cba2272ec4b14/contracts/curve_apy_vault.vy#L616) 
moves the vault's liquidity from one pool to another one. It first removes liquidity 
from the old pool and receives one token. Then, it swaps this token for the new token 
and adds liquidity to the new pool. This is followed by updating the new LP amount. 

```js
def update_pool(_out_token: address, old_i: int128, swap_route: DynArray[SwapRoute, MAX_SWAP], new_pool: address, new_deposit: address, new_i: int128, new_pool_coin_count: uint8, new_lp_token: address, new_is_crypto_pool: bool, new_lp_min_amount: uint256):
```

### `collect_crv_reward`

The 
[external CRV reward collector function](https://github.com/kallisto-finance/curve-apy-vault/blob/7b4d9a4677b434282b19a39cdf7cba2272ec4b14/contracts/curve_apy_vault.vy#L679) collects the CRV 
rewards accumulated through the Chaser vault's Curve pool. Each pool has a unique liquidity gauge.
The function checks the 

```js
def collect_crv_reward(swap_route: DynArray[SwapRoute, MAX_SWAP], i: int128, min_amount: uint256) -> uint256:
```
