:class: note

To learn more about about Paloma concepts like Luna, validators, and governance, visit the [Paloma protocol overview](../learn/protocol.md). 
:::


Follow the steps below to get started with Palomain and build your own dApp!

### 1. Set up Palomain <img src="/img/Palomain.png" height="30px">

Palomain is a user-friendly development environment for developing smart contracts. Palomain makes it easy to create smart contract templates, deploy them to the Paloma blockchain, and connect them to a frontend app.

Follow the [Palomain setup tutorial](Palomain/initial-setup.md) to get started using Palomain. 

### 2. Download LocalPaloma and start building <img src="/img/LocalPaloma.svg" height="30px">

LocalPaloma is a scaled-down Paloma blockchain that allows you to test your dApp locally. LocalPaloma provides a single validator node and [10 preconfigured wallet accounts](localPaloma/accounts.md). 

Follow the [Palomain with LocalPaloma tutorial](Palomain/using-Palomain-localPaloma.md) to start using Palomain and create a simple counter app. 

### 3. Mint an NFT <img src="/img/bullet_Paloma.svg" height="30px">

Now that you are familiar with Palomain and LocalPaloma, you can try minting an NFT with Palomain. 

The [NFT minting](Palomain/mint-an-nft.md) tutorial walks you through the creation of an NFT minting application using the dApp scaffolding and front end provided by Palomain.
