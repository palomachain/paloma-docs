# Abstract

Cross-chain communication is a complex process to securely implement.
Most of the useable cross-chain solutions today are trustfull bridge 
designs that trade-off security primitives to achieve cross-chain 
interoperability. There is generally a trade-off made with either 
generalizability, trustlessness, or extensibility. The consequences of 
such bridging solutions have resulted in hundreds of millions in lost 
or stolen funds. There is a need for trustless interoperability that is 
consensus conscious. Achieving cross-chain interoperability means being 
able to simultaneously control smart contracts on a base chain through a 
lightweight, consensus-driven message passing system. In these docs, we 
describe Paloma, a decentralized smart messaging blockchain that has fast 
state awareness, low-cost state computation and a powerful attestation system. 
Paloma enables stable, cross-chain smart contract execution with any data source.
